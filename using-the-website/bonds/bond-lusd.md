# LUSD Bond

LUSD bond was introduced on 23rd September 2021. It allows you to trade [LUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/liquity-usd) in exchange for discounted OHM on Olympus.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have LUSD in your wallet. For example, you can [go to Sushiswap to swap for LUSD](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0&outputCurrency=ETH) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [LUSD Bond page of the Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/lusd). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of LUSD you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of OHM you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Olympus contract to spend your LUSD. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
