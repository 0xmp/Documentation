# Olympus Game Theory

kleb

## Introduction

[Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) is an innovation in the way people
interact with financial protocols. The motivation behind this essay is to delve
deep into the Olympus protocol not from a technical or financial perspective but
from the perspective of analysing human interaction.

There are many fields that have something to say about human interaction but the
field of study in this essay will be game theory - the study of strategic interdependence.

This essay is aimed at a broad range of readers. If you are familiar with game
theory concepts please feel free to skip ahead to parts that interest you most.

## Game Theory Essentials

### What is Game Theory?

Game theory is the study of strategic interdependence. There are many situations
in life where the best response to a situation depends on what other people in
that situation do. Strategic situations are interesting because we can often get
multiple outcomes, some of which are remarkably stable and yet sub-optimal for
all people involved.

Consider a macroeconomic application of multiple stable outcomes under these conditions:
- Firms only invest if customers will buy goods.
- Customers only buy goods if they are paid wages.
- Customers are only paid wages by firms if customers buy goods.

The optimistic outcome:
- Firms think customers will buy goods and so expand production.
- Customers buy these goods because they think their wages are secure.
- The expanded profits allow firms to pay higher wages etc.

The pessimistic outcome:
- Firms do not think customers will buy goods and so restrict production to save
costs.
- Customers restrict their purchasing because they are uncertain about their wage
security.
- Firms profits fall, leading to cost cutting in the form of wage cutting/laying
off workers etc.

We can see that no one wants to be in the pessimistic outcome and yet still this
outcome is very plausible. To understand why, we use game theory.
