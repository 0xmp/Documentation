# Borrowing

You can start by referring to Davidâ€™s [Medium article on how to use Abracadabra](https://davidgmi.medium.com/how-to-cast-a-magic-spell-to-your-ohm-and-3-3-strategy-using-abracadabra-money-45fc6187f281) in addition to the basic explanations below.

## How to Borrow MIM

In [Pool 10](https://abracadabra.money/pool/10), You can borrow MIM using sOHM which is already staked in Olympus App. Details are below:

1. Connect your wallet and go to [Abracadabra.money Pool 10](https://abracadabra.money/pool/10).

2. Under the "WRAP" menu, wrap the amount of sOHM against which you want to borrow to wsOHM.

3. Move to "BORROW" menu, type the amount of wsOHM as you want to use as collateral, and type the amount of MIM you want to borrow.

{% hint style="info" %}
If this is your first interaction with the App, you need to approve the Abracadabra's contract to spend your token first. However, you only need to perform this once - subsequent wrapping or borrowing process doesn't require the token approval step.

## **How to Leverage**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-08-29-at-4.10.54-pm%20%281%29.png)

1. Click on "Change leverage" and choose a loop amount.

2. Depending on the loop amount \(ranges between 1 to 10\), your borrow amount, leverage, and liquidation price will be updated accordingly.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Liquidation price increases with loop amount, and a higher liquidation price means you can get liquidated more easily.
{% endhint %}

3. You can adjust the "Swap Tolerance". A lower value means your transaction is more likely to fail e.g. when the exchange rate of MIM token changes during the execution of your transaction.

4. To use a lower gas fee, click on "Update price". Then click "ADD COLLATERAL AND BORROW" and sign the transaction to open a leverage position.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You can add more collateral before your collateral price reaches the liquidation price. When you use leverage, you will forfeit all your collaterals if you get liquidated.
